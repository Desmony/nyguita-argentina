A born cavalryman, their jobs were alternating between chasing cattle and fighting during the numerous civil wars and wars of conquest. Their presence on the Argentinian territory decreased after the Great European Migration Wave and the invention of the barbed wire at the end of the 19th century. Since then, it has become a national icon of Argentina in reaction to the rapidly changing way of life brought by the Europeans.'),
