VALUES ('en_US',  'LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_BUILDING_NYGUITA_SALADERO_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1',  'A saladero was a basic industry that produced salted meat from cattle. It was one of the earliest industries of Argentina and Uruguay after the Argentine War of Independence and benefited from the expansion of a landed class into the Pampas. In time, it expanded into other products including extracting the leather, horns and fat from cows (fat was useful for public lighting, soaps and candles). By the 1840s, saladeros employed steam engines and encouraged foreign investments. During the last quarter of the nineteenth century, saladeros, along with enslaved labor, declined with the expansion of refrigeration techniques.');
